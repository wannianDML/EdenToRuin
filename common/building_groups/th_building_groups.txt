# parent_group = parent_group_key		If set, this group is considered a child of the specified group. Default no parent.
# always_possible = yes/no				If yes, building types in this group are always permitted regardless of resources in state. Default no.
# economy_of_scale = yes/no				If yes, any non-subsistence buildings in or underneath this group will get an economy of scale throughput modifier for each level > 1. Default no.
# is_subsistence = yes/no				If yes, buildings of types in this group are considered subsistence buildings that follow special rules. Default no.
# default_building = building_type_key	Specifies the default building type that will be built unless the state specifies a different one. No default.
# lens = lens_key						If specified, determines the lens buildings in this group will be sorted under. No default.
# auto_place_buildings = yes/no
# capped_by_resources = yes/no
# discoverable_resource = yes/no
# depletable_resource = yes/no
# can_use_slaves = yes/no				Default no, setting yes enables slavery for all contained buildings and groups
# land_usage = urban/rural				Which type of state resource the building uses. urban = Urbanization, rural = Arable Land. Default no state resource usage.
#										If unspecified, will return first non-default land usage type found in parent building group tree.
# cash_reserves_max = number			Maximum amount of £ (per level) that buildings in this group can store into their cash reserves. If unspecified or set to 0, it will use the value from the parent group. Default 0
# inheritable_construction =  yes/no	If yes, a construction of this building group will survive a state changing hands or a split state merging
# stateregion_max_level = yes/no		If yes, any building types in this group with the has_max_level property will consider its level restrictions on state-region rather than state level	
# urbanization = number					The amount of urbanization buildings in this group provides per level
# should_auto_expand = trigger			Under which condition buildings in this group should auto-expand if auto-expand is toggled on (trigger on more specific group or building type overrides)
# 										If this trigger has any contents at all, the game will think the building is potentially auto-expandable, so do not write triggers that can never evaluate to true here
# hiring_rate = X						How much of the building's max staffing level can be hired in a single week (default NDefines::NEconomy::HIRING_RATE)
# proportionality_limit = X				How high is the building's tolerance for pop types being out of proportion? default NDefines::NEconomy::EMPLOYMENT_PROPORTIONALITY_LIMIT)
# hires_unemployed_only = yes			If yes, buildings in this group may only hire from the unemployment pool. Default no.
